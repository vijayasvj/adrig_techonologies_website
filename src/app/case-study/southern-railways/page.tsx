            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Southern Railways is a cornerstone of transportation in Southern India, responsible for connecting millions of passengers and facilitating the movement of goods across vast distances. However, the organization faced persistent challenges in its maintenance scheduling processes. Maintenance tasks were traditionally scheduled during midnight hours to minimize disruptions to passenger services. Unfortunately, securing labor for these late-night operations proved difficult for field engineers. This led to irregular maintenance timings that, while often approved by management due to practical realities, resulted in frequent, unplanned train stoppages.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">These unscheduled disruptions caused cascading effects, delaying not only passenger services but also the lucrative freight operations that Southern Railways relies on for revenue. The inefficiencies in maintenance scheduling not only impacted operational reliability but also posed significant financial losses. Recognizing the critical need for a solution, Southern Railways approached VIT University, which facilitated a collaboration with ADRIG AI Technologies to develop a comprehensive solution.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Solution with ADRIG AI Technologies</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">To address these challenges, ADRIG AI Technologies designed and implemented a cutting-edge end-to-end application tailored specifically to the needs of Southern Railways. The goal was to streamline the maintenance scheduling process, improve operational efficiency, and maximize revenue from freight operations.</p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Key Features of the Solution:</h3>
                <ul className="text-gray-700 mt-2 list-disc pl-6">
                  <li><b>Request & Approval Workflow:</b> Field engineers can now submit maintenance requests specifying their preferred times. These requests are reviewed and approved by managers, ensuring that operational feasibility and on-the-ground realities are both considered.</li>
                  <li><b>Optimization Algorithm:</b> Once a request is approved, the admin triggers our advanced optimization algorithm. This algorithm leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze work descriptions, assess task priorities, and identify the most efficient scheduling windows.</li>
                  <li><b>Intelligent Scheduling:</b> The system factors in multiple parameters, including train-free windows, the timing of existing maintenance activities, and priority levels of different tasks. For example, if maintenance is scheduled from Station A to B, the algorithm ensures that subsequent maintenance from B to C is coordinated efficiently to minimize disruptions. This holistic approach significantly reduces the likelihood of unplanned train stoppages.</li>
